# Hangman-Project-1
This is a game where the user must guess the letters of a 'secret word' within a set number of tries (currently 7). If the user guesses the word within the number of tries, they are declared the winner and given the option to play again. If the user is unable to guess the word, they are declared the loser, shown the answer and given the option to play again. Each miss adds an element to the 'hangman.'
## Motivation
